Known issues:
Online/Total counts in the friends list sometimes go haywire. Not often or by a large margin, but it happens.
Import/Export buttons don't work. Or they try to and break. Don't use 'em.
Skin menu doesn't work - On hold until we actually have some skins to show - Ascent will have its own "branded" skin at some point.
